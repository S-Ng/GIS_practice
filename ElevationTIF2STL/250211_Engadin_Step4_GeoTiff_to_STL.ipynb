    "This code is the 4th step in a project to 3D print a model of the Engadin valley in Switzerland as a Christmas gift to a friend who is skiing the Engadin Ski Marathon this year! The project has 5 steps: <br/>\n",
    "1. Select area of interest from an open source Swiss elevation dataset (https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/height-model-swissalti3d). I used \"selection by polygon\" at 2.0m resolution to obtain a csv file with links to tiles covering the entire Engadin Ski Marathon and surrounding mountains. <br/>\n",
    "2. Merge linked GeoTiff tiles in exported csv file into one file <br/>\n",
    "3. Add geospatial features in QGIS, ArcGIS, etc such as trails, cities, etc. Note that additional features need to be represented as elevation data merged with the exported GeoTiff so they will be part of the eventual 3D print! Also a good time to resample the pixel resolution. 2 meter resolution won't show up for a reasonably scaled 3D print but WILL make processing times horrific. Something like 30 meter resolution is better. This is also the time to re-mask your area of interest since the swisstopo site exports blocky edges on diagonals. <br/>\n",
    "4. Convert edited GeoTiff to STL mesh for slicing and 3D printing (<<< that's what this code does!) \n",
    "5. Slice and 3D print it!"
