Just-for-fun project to 3D-print a model of Engadin skimarathon in Switzerland as a Christmas gift for my parents who are going to ski the Engadin in March. Aiming to use new GIS coding skills to use publically available elevation data. <br>
2 files to process swiss elevation data into an STL mesh file for 3d printing. <br>
1st file (241217_access_merge_elevation_data) takes csv file exported from https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/height-model-swissalti3d . File opens links to tiled elevation tifs and merges them into a single tif for the desired area selected from the website. <br>
2nd file (241219_Tif_to_STL) takes the merged tif file with elevation data and processes it into a triangulated mesh for export as an STL. This script is based on code from ChatGPT, which I practiced using to expedite my code-writing process.
