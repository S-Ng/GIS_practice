# Chronical of Simon's GIS journey of enlightenment
items in reverse chronological order

## January - February, 2025
Following U-Tennessee, Knoxville course Geography 510 by Dr. Qiusheng Wu ([syllabus](https://geog-510.gishub.org/book/about/syllabus.html)). Course teaches skills to create open-source Python packages for geospatial analysis. ([Github repository](https://github.com/S-Ng/Geog510))

## December, 2024
Just-for-fun project to 3D-print a model of Engadin skimarathon in Switzerland. Found elevation data here (https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/height-model-swissalti3d). Open and merge tifs for desired area, then processes merged tif into triangulated mesh for export as STL and subsequent 3D printing.

## September - November, 2024
Participated in NASA DEVELOP internship focusing on remote sensing. Learned python tools to access and process remote sensing imagery, specifically from Sentinel-2.

## February, 2024
Big progress. I wrote some code in the QGIS python consol. To start, I followed a tutorial by Ujaval Gandhi (https://www.qgistutorials.com/sl/docs/3/getting_started_with_pyqgis.html). Then I went wild, adding pandas to build off the tutorial and start translating my general python skills to PyQGIS.

## January, 2024
Starting with a humble OpenCourseware course from MIT (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-str-001-geographic-information-system-gis-tutorial-january-iap-2022), I intend to become familiar with QGIS and then to begin learning how to integrate Python.
