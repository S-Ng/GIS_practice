This folder contains the QGIS files and PDF reports I created as part of an OpenCourseware course from MIT (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-str-001-geographic-information-system-gis-tutorial-january-iap-2022) <br/>
Level 1 of the workshop introduced basic GIS concepts, including layers, vector vs raster, attribute tables, metadata, and map-making, among other details. <br/>
Level 2 of the workshop introduced map projections, processing tools, and spatial analyses (including spatial statistics and network analysis). <br/>
Both levels used the same example to practice these skills - picking a suitable site for a new mixed-use community building in Hudson County, NJ, based on unemployment data, transit options, and topography.
