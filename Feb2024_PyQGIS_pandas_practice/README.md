Using tutorial (https://www.qgistutorials.com/sl/docs/3/getting_started_with_pyqgis.html) and their linked Natural Earth airport dataset (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/airports/) \n
I built off the tutorial using pandas to manipulate the data and then created a new vector layer based on that manipulated data. \n
Here's slightly more detail: in the python console of QGIS, I uploaded a .shp file with information about all international airports, then followed the tutorial to export the lat and long of each airport in a .txt file. I uploaded the .txt file into a pandas dataframe, sliced out airports within 10 degrees of the equator, exported this as a csv, then imported the csv as a new layer with a different color from the original file. 
All of this could have been done in excel, it's true, but this was some fun practice. \n
The .py file is my code. The .pdf has some notes from my troubleshooting during the coding process. The .html .shp .shx .VERSION.txt .cpg .dbf .prj files are from the datasource (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/airports/). The .csv and .txt files are my intermediate file outputs while the .qgz is the QGIS project file.
